# The Bot[WIP]
I created The Bot because I was bored.<br>
It can do random stuff.
# How to self-host
**Make sure [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed on your computer**<br>
First run this command
```sh
npm install
```
Then create a file called ```.env``` and enter the following (replace your_token with your bots token)
```env
TOKEN=your_token
```
Now run 
```sh
npm start
```
The Bot Should Get Online
